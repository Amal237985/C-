# Image compression idea with method of singular value decomposition in C++

In this project we come up with how the linear algebraic methods like QR decomposition ,Singular value decomposition methods can be implemented for a matrix to find eigen values and eigen vectors using iterative methods.This idea can be used for the compression of images by converting image into matrices of RGB and restricting the eigen values that are passed while the process so that the content of the images can be reduced by removing small eigen values.


Created an hpp file with used function of matrix operations and QR decomposition which is used in the project.
